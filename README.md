THE DISTANT FUTURE
==================

Javascript clone of one of my favourite childhood games, the classic isometric shooter Syndicate!  
This was a runner up in  the 8WeekGame competition 2013.  

Entrants could create any game they liked, using any technology they liked, provided 
it was all coded from scratch and within the 8 week time limit!

Apologies to anyone whom I've ripped off for use of their grapics/ sounds- all assets 
were sourced from frantic google searches, mostly on the evening of the last day!  A lot of
the graphics were taken from the Original BullFrog/ EA game Syndicate.
